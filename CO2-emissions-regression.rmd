***This code will perform the following steps:***

1.  *Data preprocessing*: The code will

-   remove rows with missing values
-   convert numbers char variables to numerical factors
-   rename the variables in a meanigful way
-   get rid of the useless columns
-   create new ones useful for our model

2.  *Data visualization and exploration:* The code will

-   create box plots to visualize the distribution of CO2 Emissions
    across different vehicle sizes, transmission, fuel types
-   create scatter plots to visualize the relationship between CO2
    Emissions and quantitative variables (with qualitative variables
    group labeling to spo patterns)

    some of the variables in the dataset

3.  Hypothesis exploration: The code will highlight the following
    hypotheses that were either logically assumed or intuitively
    withdrawn from the previous data exploration and visualization

4.  Linear regression: The code will build linear regression model to
    test the hypotheses including

## Data

The Dataset used for this project has been downloaded from [Government
of Canada's Open Data](https://open.canada.ca/en).\
It's specifically published by the [Natural Resources of
Canada](#attribution), [Fuel consumption section -
2023](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64/resource/b6100f60-5e63-437d-b122-db76c467c0a7).

## Data Preprocessing

::: {#data-cleaning-removing-na-values .section .level3}
### Data cleaning: removing NA values

This is dedicated to removing empty rows and columns from the dataset.\
steps to follow:

-   removes all the columns containing missing values (plenty of empty
    columns)
-   removes all the rows containing missing values ( description of the
    dataset at the ed of the file\
    Practically, there should be 14 columns i the dataset (as per the
    description above) but heres how many there is. Moreover the data
    ends at row 834, proof:

``` {r}
print(paste("number of columns:", ncol(df) ,"; number of rows:", nrow(df)))
```

Checking is there exists any missing values in the dataset, if yes
returns TRUE.\
*(it does return True in many columns, some columns are purely empty,
and we need to fix this in our data frame)*

``` {r}
#head(is.na(df),n=2) # checks if our dataset contains missing values, hid cz output is too large
#summary(df) # checks how many NA we do have
#the output is hidden becuase it's huge
```

**Removing empty columns**

``` {r}
df <- subset(df, select = !apply(is.na(df), 2, any)) 
print(paste("number of columns after:", ncol(df))) #removes all the columns containing missing values
```

**Removing the useless rows:**

-   First 2 rows in data combine to mean the header - remove one of them
    `(check how in the code below)`
-   Last row is 833 - remove what follows
    `(check how in the code below)`

*(we have a proof from before that the \# of rows is far more greater
than 833)*

``` {r}
head(df, n=2)
```

::: {pagedtable="false"}
:::

``` {r}
print(df[832:836,])
```

checking these from data set:

``` {r}
df <- df[2:834,]
print(paste("number of rows after:", nrow(df)))
```

**Checking the presence of duplicate rows that have the same
information:**

``` {r}
# Check for duplicate rows
has_duplicates <- any(duplicated(df) | duplicated(df, fromLast = TRUE))
if (has_duplicates) {
  print("The dataset contains at least two rows with the same information.")
} else {
  print("The dataset does not contain two rows with the same information. The dataset has no duplicate rows")
}
```

::: {#data-cleaning-columns-naming-conventions .section .level3}
### Data cleaning: columns naming conventions

Notice how the header of the data has unconventional names:

``` {r}
colnames(df)
```

This is bad :/ We need to fix this:

``` {r}
new_names <- c("model_year", "car_make", "model_name", "vehicle_class", "engine_size", "transmission", "fuel_type", "city_consumption", "hwy_consumption", "mix_consumption", "mix_consumption_2", "CO2_emission", "CO2_rate", "smog_rate" ) 

colnames(df) <- new_names
colnames(df)
```

::: {#data-cleaning-data-type-conversion .section .level3}
### Data cleaning: data type conversion

Make sure the numbers are converted to the right data type:

-   numerical values/ measures --\> double
-   rank values --\> factor

``` {r}
glimpse(df) #checks what type of data each feature is 
```

    

``` {r}
df <- transform(df, 
                      engine_size=as.numeric(engine_size),
                      city_consumption=as.numeric(city_consumption),
                      hwy_consumption=as.numeric(hwy_consumption),
                      mix_consumption=as.numeric(mix_consumption),

                      CO2_emission=as.numeric(CO2_emission),
                      CO2_rate=as.factor(CO2_rate),
                      smog_rate=as.factor(smog_rate)
                    )

```
:::

::: {#data-cleaning-columns-editing .section .level3}
### Data cleaning: Columns editing

*Dropping 2 and Mutating 2 :)*

1.  The `model year` is 2023 for all instances, thus we will drop it.

``` {r}
unique(df$model_year)
```

``` {r}
df <- subset(df, select = - model_year)
```

**p.s.** `mix_consumption` is measured i L/100 km, `mix_consumption_2` i
MPG; converting between them is via the following formula: we will only
use one of them as predictor - drop the second one.

$$
mpg = \frac{235.215}{L/100 km}
$$

``` {r}
df <- subset(df, select = - mix_consumption_2)
```

2.  `Transmission` and `Vehicle_class` have too may values that can
    easily get grouped in new cols:

-   Transmission is either Automatic or Manual (if starts with A
    automatic, M manual)\
-   Vehicle class gives rise to vehicle_size_category based on its size:
    small, medium, large or special (*this includes special purpose cars
    and 2 seaters*)

``` {r}
unique(df$vehicle_class)
```

``` {r}
unique(df$transmission)
```

``` {r}
df <- mutate(df, vehicle_size_category = case_when(
  vehicle_class == "Full-size" ~ "Large",
  vehicle_class == "SUV: Standard" ~ "Medium",
  vehicle_class == "Mid-size" ~ "Medium",
  vehicle_class == "Minicompact"~ "Small",
  vehicle_class == "SUV: Small"~"Small",
  vehicle_class == "Compact"~"Small",
  vehicle_class == "Two-seater"~"Special",
  vehicle_class == "Subcompact"~"Small",
  vehicle_class == "Station wagon: Small"~"Small",
  vehicle_class == "Station wagon: Mid-size"~"Medium",
  vehicle_class == "Pickup truck: Small"~"Small",
  vehicle_class == "Pickup truck: Standard"~"Medium",
  vehicle_class == "Special purpose vehicle"~"Special",
  vehicle_class == "Minivan"~"Small"
))


df <- mutate(df, transmission_type_category = case_when(
  grepl("^A", df$transmission) ~ "Automatic",
  grepl("^M", df$transmission) ~ "Manual",
))

colnames(df)
```

3.  Lastly, `CO2 rate` and `Smog rate` are concluded based on the CO2
    emitted, thus for this regression task of response `yCO2_emissions`,
    we must drop these values from the tale useless

``` {r}
df <- subset(df, select = - CO2_rate)
df <- subset(df, select = - smog_rate)
```

Final data frame has the following:

``` {r}
colnames(df)
```

### Data exploration: outliers

**Extreme outlier cars are the ones that pollute the most (or very low emissions - which is not the case here as you ca see now). They are often older, bigger, and more powerful than most cars. In this project we're interested in studying what makes a car have that irregular level of CO2 emitted. This is why, we need to detect them to later on reflect on their properties.**   

*Two extreme outliers are showing*

```{r}
outliers <- vector()
q1 <- quantile(df$CO2_emission, 0.25)
q3 <- quantile(df$CO2_emission, 0.75)

for (i in 1:nrow(df)) {
  lower_bound <- q1 - 3 * IQR(df$CO2_emission) #extreme outliers because why not :p
  upper_bound <- q3 + 3 * IQR(df$CO2_emission)

  if (df$CO2_emission[i] < lower_bound | df$CO2_emission[i] > upper_bound) {
    outliers <- append(outliers, i) #app if its lower or upper than the limits
    print(df[i,])
  }
}


```

_Notice how the two outliers found have a CO2 emission of >600 g/km. They are both Bugattis, large cars with large engines, and use premium fuel... These make sense to any car expert: they are indeed pollutants. However, we're data scientists! We find the pattern with numbers! At the end of this project, the models will actually explain how we can get to such conclusions. Every feature that contributed to this high emission will be broken down into pieces and analyzed._

## Data Visualization:

Before coming up with hypotheses to test on the data, we need to look
for patterns and relationships. This can be done via plotting (mainly
scatterplots for nums, boxplots for categorical and correlation
matrices)

ggplot(data=df) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x=vehicle_size_category, y=CO2_emission, fill=vehicle_size_category))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())
```

*Notice how some vehicle types like `2 seater` which is a special car
have exceptionally a high production of CO2 whereas a `small minivan`
which is small relatively has ecological levels of emissions.* *A
pattern is present where it is shown that cars that are considered as
special have relatively higher CO2 Emissions than other types of cars.*

**P.S. Notice that a special car has a suspicious level of CO2 emissions
greater than 600 \~maybe outlier or \~maybe not. (Later On)**

the CO2 emitted by the car.*

```

*Additional data exploration gives an extra evidence that the CO2
emissions are not affected by the general transmission type of the car.*
*We should look at the individual transmission types*

``` {r}
ggplot(data=df) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x=transmission, y=CO2_emission, fill=transmission))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())
```

*Individual transmission do have a clearer relationship with the amount
of CO2 emitted.*

*i.e. a specific transmission type can affect the repsonse*

greater than 600 \~maybe outlier or \~maybe not. (Later On)**

    CO2.*

*This pattern is perceived if the visualizations were just made on these
2 variables. Fortunately, we can visualize the pattern using additional

    Z.  -   purple - & the higher the CO2 emitted
-   The smaller the engine the more likely it is using regular gasoline
    X.  -   blue - & the lower the CO2 emitted

premiuim gasoline has a suspicious level of CO2 emissions greater than

### **Engine size and Transmission types**

``` {r}

```

*There is no apparent relationship between engine_size and transmission
type specifically when it comes to CO2 emissions; It only seems that
automatic is more widely used in comparison to manual. However, mainly
looking at engine_size, the larger the engine_size, the larger the
emission of CO2*

:::

::: {#fuel-consumption-fuel-type-and-co2 .section .level3}
### **Fuel consumption, fuel type and CO2**

This general pattern persists when looking at the fuel consumption in a
specific road (city, highway or both) as seen in the cor matrix. Here
we're vizualizing consumption in a mixed road - having it the most
tightly correlated with CO2 levels. (see matrix next)

``` {r}
ggplot(data=df) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=mix_consumption, y=CO2_emission, color=fuel_type)) +
  facet_wrap(~ fuel_type, nrow=2)
```

*In general type D and X and E show a lower consumption (Z reaches very
high values) when driving in combination of highway and city, resulting
in lower emissions*
*As per the density curve shown [here](#density-curve-of-co2-emission-based-on-the-fuel-type)
if we compare the distribution of the D fuel type with the density curve, we can notice that the diesel has relatively a predictable and low CO2 emissions. In other words, we can notice on the density curve, that the red curve represents that the diesel fuel type has relatively a small standard deviation (and this is shown in the correlation matrix).
In addition, we can notice that the premium fuel type is the one that has the largest emissions of CO2 (shown in the density curve and in the correlation matrix)*
:::

::: {#correlation-matrix .section .level3}
### **Correlation matrix**

``` {r}
pairs(~engine_size+city_consumption+hwy_consumption+mix_consumption+CO2_emission, df, col = "#009ACD")

corr_matrix <- cor(df[, c("engine_size","city_consumption", "hwy_consumption", "mix_consumption", "CO2_emission")])
pal <- colorRampPalette(c("#b3cde0", "#6497b1" ,"#011f4b"))(100)
heatmap(cor(corr_matrix), col=pal)


```

*Notice how the patterns are very strongly correlated when it comes
between fuel consumption in city, highway, mix and the CO2 emission.
There exist a mild correlation between engine_size and the rest - both
the `correlation between all types of fuel consumption` and the
`not-very-linear relationship between engine_size and CO2 emission` shall
be studied later*


## Hypotheses:

From what we have seen in the visualizations above, boxplots, scatter
plots and correlation matrices we can ask the following questions:

*Simple Linear Regression:*

-   **Is there a significant relationship between engine_size and CO2
    emission?**\
    As per the relationship perceived
    [here](#engine-size-and-co2-emissions), the larger the engine, the
    higher the emission.

$H_0$: There is no linear relationship between
engine size and CO2 emission of the car

-   **Is there a significant relationship between the vehicle type and
    CO2 emission?** An interesting question that we would like to test
    is whether each vehicle class has a specific CO2 level emitted to
    check which are the most ecological and which are the most
    deleterious on the env.

$H_0$: There is no linear relationship between
vehicle class and CO2 emission of the car

*Multiple Linear Regression:*

-   **Is there a useful linear relationship between CO2 emissions and
    any of the predictors?** Application of backward elimination

$H_0$: There is no linear relationship between
all predictors and CO2 emission of the car

*+ Interaction effect:*

-   **Is there an interaction between engine size and fuel type? or does the effect of engine size depend on fuel type**\
    Notice there is a [pattern here](#engine-size-and-fuel-types) when
    looking at the different CO2 emissions for different instances of
    engine_sizes with their corresponding fuel type

-   **Is there an interaction between fuel type and fuel consumption?**\
    Notice how, when filtered by fuel types
    [here](#fuel-consumption,-fuel-type-and-CO2), Some fuel types show
    substantially lower consumption than others, which might in turn
    affect emissions since they are highly correlated.

-   **Is there an interaction between fuel type and fuel consumption, & engine size and fuel type?**
    Checking if the inter actors behave simultaneously and affect the response.

*Polynomial Regression:*

-   **Does a linear model of engine size and a larger polynomial model
    (of degree 3) fit the data equally well?**

In [this correlation matrix](#correlation-matrix), `engine_size` seem
like the only feature not to have a strongly positive correlation with
the CO2 emissions, it seems like a case worth studying on a higher
degree polynomial!!

**Interpretation:**

-   P_value \< 0.05, thus we reject $H_0$ which means that there is a linear
    relationship between engine size and CO2 emissions.\
-   The positive coefficient estimates for different engine_sizes
    indicate the expected increase in CO2 emissions for each level of
    engine_size compared to the reference level (Intercept).\
-   The model appears to explain a significant portion of the variation
    in CO2 emissions, as indicated by the high R-squared value `0.636`.\
-   The residuals are relatively small (`38.8`) and the coefficients
    have a low standard error, which is a sign of a good fit.

    expected decrease in CO2 emissions.
- 	Some levels of vehicle class have coefficients with low p-values, 
    indicating statistical significance. These levels have a significant effect on 
    CO2 emissions. For example, '\*' and '\*\*\*' significance codes suggest 
    highly significant effects (*** > * in significance)
-   In our model, R squared is  around 0.3073. This means that roughly 30.73% of 
    the variance in CO2 emissions is explained by the vehicle class. This could be an indication
    of a poor model
-   The residual standard error (RSE) is 53.91, which does represent generally a low RSE.        This RSE along with R squared indicates that the model is poor.
**The interpretation of the metrics indicate that the model of simple linear regression of the CO2 emissions onto the vehice class is a poor fit.**

### Multiple Regression: Backward Selection

``` {r}
full_model <- lm(CO2_emission ~ ., data = df)
final <- step(full_model, direction = "backward")
```
   
``` {r}
summary(final)
```

The main predictors that persisted the elimination:

-   fuel type: (3 dummy var expressing 4 different types)

    -   any fuel - there is a contribution in \~ 35g/km CO2 emitted (if
        diesel aloe it will e strictly this value)
    -   else if fuel is ethanol (E85), there will e \~ 157 decrease in
        the qty emitted than diesel
    -   else if fuel is regular gas (X) \~ 34 decrease
    -   else premium (Z) \~ 35 decrease

    DIESEL IS THE MOST POLLUTANT

-   city_consumption: 1u up will results in 9.4 g/km of CO2

-   hwy_consumption: 1u up will results in 7.5 g/km of CO2

-   mix_consumption: 1u up will results in 6.3 g/km of CO2

**Interpretation:**
-   The R-squared value is 0.999, indicating that approximately 99.9% of the variance in CO2     emissions is explained by the predictors in the model.
-   The F-statistic has an extremely low p-value (< 2.2e-16), which indicates that the model     is highly significant, thus indicating that at least one of the predictors or                interactions is influential in explaining CO2 emissions.
-   All the coefficients have low significant p-values. This is an indication of a great         model.
-   The residual standard error (RSE) is 2.045, which represents generally a low RSE. This       RSE indicates a very good and significant fit.
To sum up, the model generated by backward selection is a very good and significant model.

::: {#interaction-effect .section .level3}
### Interaction Effect:

::: {#is-there-an-interaction-between-engine_size-and-fuel-type .section .level4}
#### \***Is there an interaction between engine_size and fuel type?**

``` {r}
int_engine_fuel_model <- lm(CO2_emission ~ engine_size*fuel_type, data = df)
summary(int_engine_fuel_model)
```

There is no interaction effect between any of the fuel types and the
engine_size!!! We can only conclude the following (based of p value): \*
CO2 is up 36.7g/km when engine_size is bigger in 1 unit \* y default, fuel
will increase CO2 160g/km \* regular gas X only +130g/km

i.e. so any increase in engine_size will affect the CO2 emitted strictly
y its coefficient (same for the use of a particular fuel type) - do not
depend/interact with each other


### **Is there an interaction between fuel type and fuel consumption in a combination of city and highway roads?**

``` {r}
int_mix_fuel_model <- lm(CO2_emission ~ mix_consumption*fuel_type, data = df)
summary(int_mix_fuel_model)
```

Overall, this model suggests that the interaction between mix 
consumption and fuel type significantly influences CO2 emissions, 
and the model has a very high level of explanatory power.

**Interpretation:**

-   The R-squared value (0.9992) is very high, indicating that a large proportion of the         variance in CO2 emissions is explained
    by the predictors, including the interaction term.   
    
-   The F-statistic has an extremely low p-value, this means that the model 
    is highly significant, indicating that at least one 
    of the predictors, including the interaction terms, 
    is influential in explaining CO2 emissions.  
    
-   It is true that not all the coefficients are significant (have a low p-value), but the       significance codes suggest that most coefficients, especially all the **interaction          terms** , are highly significant.


*This interpretation suggests that the interaction between mix consumption and fuel type is very significant.*

### **What happens if we perform a multiple regression model and include both interactions terms**
```{r}
multi_model <- lm(CO2_emission ~ engine_size*fuel_type + mix_consumption*fuel_type, data = df)

# View the summary of the model
summary(multi_model)
```

Overall, whenever we combine the interaction terms, this can lead to a high statistical significance.

**Interpretation:**

-   The R-squared value is 0.9992, indicating that approximately 99.92% of the variance in CO2 emissions is explained by the predictors and their interactions in the       model.

-   The F-statistic has an extremely low p-value (< 2.2e-16), which indicates that the model     is highly significant, thus indicating that at least one of the predictors or                interactions is influential in explaining CO2 emissions.

-   It is true that not all the coefficients are significant (have a low p-value), but           the significance codes suggest that most coefficients, especially all the **interaction      terms** , are highly significant. 

-   The residual standard error (RSE) is 1.798, which represents generally a low RSE. This RSE indicates a very good and significant fit.

### Residual Plot to Determine Patterns
```{r}
# Compute the residuals
residuals <- resid(slr_engine_model)

# Create a scatterplot of residuals against the fitted values
plot(fitted(slr_engine_model), residuals,
     xlab = "Fitted Values",
     ylab = "Residuals",
     main = "Residual Plot",
     pch = 19) 

# Add a Lowess curve to the plot
lines(lowess(fitted(slr_engine_model), residuals), col = "blue")
```

*Notice from the residual plot that we can see a pattern. The presence of a pattern in the plots indicate a problem with some aspect of the linear model. There is a little pattern in the residuals, suggesting that applying polynomial regression can improve the fit to the data*

### Polynomial Regression

**note: a polynomial model is still a linear regression model since the coef are linear.**

```{r}
pol_engine_model <- lm(CO2_emission ~ poly(engine_size, 3), data=df)
summary(pol_engine_model)
#plot(df$engine_size, df$CO2_emission, xlab = "engine_size", ylab= "CO2 levels", col= "#B9BDC1", pch=20)
```

* R squared is 0.6648, i.e. the model explain 66.48% of the variation in the dependent variable
* F is high enough (548) to conclude that independent variables are jointly etter off in predicting the dependent variable than what's done individually.
* $H_0$ is rejected (p<0.05), the poly model is superior to the simple one degree model.   


What does that mean?

- The coefficient for poly(engine_size, 3)1 is positive and highly significant, indicating that CO2 emissions increase as engine size increases. The coefficients for poly(engine_size, 3)2 is negative and significant, indicating that the rate of increase in CO2 emissions slows down as engine size increases. The poly(engine_size, 3)3 is + again.
- Engine size affects how much CO2 a car emits. The bigger the engine, the more CO2 the car emits. But the rate at which CO2 emissions increase slows down as engine size increases.
), the only outliers that are present in our dataset are the ones with CO2 emi
## Conclusion of the Outliers

*As it was mentioned [before](#data-exploration-outliers) outliers that are present in our dataset are the ones with CO2 emissions = 608, and this was the value that we were constantly mentioning with the visualization of each plot (our famous P.S.). Hence,let's recall a major concept in statistics: Outliers are data points that significantly differ from the majority of the data in a dataset. While outliers are typically considered as unusual or extreme values, they can sometimes have legitimate reasons for their presence. And this is the case of our outliers; they have large CO2 emissions for legitimate reasons. This reason is: Heterogeneity. In certain datasets, heterogeneity or diversity among data points can lead to outliers. For example, in a dataset of income, a few individuals with exceptionally high incomes may be outliers, but they are valid data points.If we go back to our outliers in our dataset, we can see that it is a result of heterogeneity, because if we inspect about our outliers, we discover that they are bugati cars with engine size = 8, they use premium gasoline and they are 2 seated(special). Hence, we notice that the bugati outlier is to the heterogeneity or diversity among data points.*
