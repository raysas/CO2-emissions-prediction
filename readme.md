# Data Mining Project

This is a mutliphase projet for the Data Mining course at LAU in Fall 2023. The project is divided into 3 phases:

- Phase 1: Regression
- Phase 2: Classification
- Phase 3: Clustering

This is phase 1 of the project, The data is taken from Open Canada, natural resources. It includes vehicle information and CO2 emission levels for 2023. The data is available in the data folder.

## Phase 1: Regression

In this phase we used preprocessing steps to clean the data, and then used 3 different regression algorithms to predict the CO2 emission levels. The algorithms used are:

- simple linear regression
- multiple linear regression
- polynomial regression

We applied data exploration and visualization to understand the data and the relationship between the features and the target variable. We also applied feature selection to reduce the number of features and improve the performance of the models (used backward selection in one of the MLR models). We created new columns and grouped some observations together to come up witj generalized and more useful conclusions.
